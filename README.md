# All-Projects
Hello & welcome everyone,
This repository holds all of my personal projects.

In this repository I have uploaded all the projects that I have coded through-out the years of my python journey as a developer, my projects are given below :

  o IDK - This personally is my favourite as I use this all the time to get rid of extra clicks while programming, you can check it out 
          & download it from here - http://tetraofficial.unaux.com/idk.html
          
  o Ludo - A popular strategy game
  o Digital clock - this is my first EEL project in python, a GUI digital clock
  o Jumbo Text Editor - My laptop is an old one, and stuff like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, Vim run very slowly slowing down my workflow. So I decided to make a GUI lightest         program with python to write code, I put it to the test & sublime text took 29 Seconds to launch, and Jumbo took only 10 Seconds to launch. So I think it works flawlessly in       my 7 years old laptop, how about yours? Let me know in the discussion tab and if there are any issues then let me know in the Issues tab, Thanks.

Those are all the projects for now, but as I work more on personal projects I'll add them here in this repository, so if you are interested then you might want to Bookmark this page
