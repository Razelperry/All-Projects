# All-Projects
Hello & welcome everyone,
This repository holds all of my personal projects.

In this repository I have uploaded all the projects that I have coded through-out the years of my python journey as a developer, my projects are given below :

  o IDK - This personally is my favourite as I use this all the time to get rid of extra clicks while programming, you can check it out 
          & download it from here - http://tetraofficial.unaux.com/idk.html
          
  o Ludo - A popular strategy game
  o Digital clock - this is my first EEL project in python, a GUI digital clock


Those are all the projects for now, but as I work more on personal projects I'll add them here in this repository, so if you are interested then you might want to Bookmark this page
